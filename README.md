# Datacentric Competition - Sheldon

This project is the data-centric competition held by Andrew NG, landing AI and deeplearning.ai.
https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/.

The Data-Centric AI Competition inverts the traditional format and instead asks you to 
improve a dataset given a fixed model.

The src code included is the one that I used to get rank as 36 out of more than 2400 submissions as per
the post on linked in by Andrew.
**36. Reinforcement_Data_Aug0309V2 0.83347**
compared to the baseline performance of 0.64421.
